							<p>My name is Christopher Sean Hermansyah, currently I'm having a study as an undergraduate at BINUS University with Cyber Security as my Major. I learned and having a lot of experience from defending and trying to hack confidental data as a white hat hacker. I'm confident on my skill as a white hat hacker to provide help by protecting data from malicious activity inside the web.</p>
							<p>While being a white hat hacker for my major study at Cyber Security, I also learned a lot of new skills on the side. Some of the skill may vary from my job description, but i took a liking on that activity as my hobby. Skills that i learne are vary, from design, event and Data Analysis. I'm also having a lot of training to get some of these skills, including the data Analysis, which is now currently needed for many company or organization.</p>
							<p>With that in mind, I'm also have a lot of project in my studies at BINUS University, which some of it I can't share. While doing a project I usually have a role as a Team Leader, which help me to understand people more better and what approach is needed for every project, let it for the personal/team approach.</p>
